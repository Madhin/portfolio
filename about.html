      <p>“  Hi, my name is Madhin. I'm a Manchester-based Junior Software Developer
        with a passion for code and problem solving. Previously I had been working in the fashion retail industry as a Merchandiser for companies like Next and Asos. This has given me a solid business foundation which I hope to build on with the Web Developer course at Nology. Please see below the skills I have learnt over the last 3 months.  ”
